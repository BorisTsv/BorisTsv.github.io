<center><h2> MATH 146B: Introduction to Ordinary and Partial Differential Equation</br>Winter 2024</h2></center>
<b>Instructor: Boris Tsvelikhovskiy </b> &nbsp&nbsp <small>borist AT ucr.edu</small>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The course will commence with a systematic exploration of higher-order linear equations. Subsequently, a substantial portion of the curriculum will be dedicated to discovering power series solutions near ordinary and singular points. 
  It is crucial to revisit fundamental concepts of power series (ratio test, radius and interval of convergence, Taylor series, etc.), previously covered in Calculus. Following this, our focus will shift to partial differential equations, 
  involving derivatives with respect to more than one variable. The quest for solutions will naturally lead to the examination of boundary value problems for ordinary differential equations and Fourier series. 
  The course will include numerous concrete examples essential for a deeper understanding of the material, drawn from Physics and applied mathematics, such as Bessel's equation, Euler's equation, heat conduction, 
  wave Equation, and many other.
