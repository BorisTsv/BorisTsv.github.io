<p>I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://mathdept.ucr.edu/" >Department of Mathematics </a> at the University of California, Riverside. </p>
<p>My research interests are mainly evolved around representation theory and its interactions with algebraic geometry and combinatorics.</p>
<p>I finished my Ph.D. in 2020 at <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics/" > Northeastern University </a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/" > Ivan Losev </a> and <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/gtodorov/#_ga=2.259945994.1274689294.1609725587-1396690592.1548539923" > Gordana Todorov </a>. 
My Ph.D. thesis was dedicated to the study of <br>categories O on Nakajima quiver varieties associated to bouquet graphs. Please find it <a href="Thesis.pdf"> here</a>.</p>
<p>While my Masters in <a href="https://math.hse.ru/en/" > Higher School of Economics </a>, I studied the combinatorial properties of shuffle algebras
with two parameters and, in particular, obtained the Hilbert series for the quotients of these algebras by ideals of certain type. This project was suggested and advised by <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/1019367" > Boris Feigin </a>.</p>
