<li> Oct. 7, Roman Fedorov: Geometric Satake correspondence, <a href="RomanNotes.pdf"> slides</a> <br> 
<b>Abstract.</b> Let G be a reductive group and Gr_G be its affine Grassmannian.<br> 
Following a paper of Mirkovic and Vilonen, I will explain that the<br> 
category of G_O-equivariant perverse sheaves on Gr_G is equivalent to<br> 
the category of representations of the Langlands dual group of G.<br> 
Somewhat surprisingly, this can be taken as the definition of the<br> 
Langlands dual group. I will not assume that the listeners are<br> 
familiar with perverse sheaves but I will assume some knowledge of<br> 
affine Grassmannians.<br> 
<li> Oct. 21, Boris Tsvelikhovskiy: Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles and polytopes, <a href="MirkovicVilonenCyclesPresentation.pdf"> slides</a> <br> 
<b>Abstract.</b>  We will start by quickly reviewing the (classical) Satake isomorphism and then  <br> 
the geometric Satake correspondence. Under this correspondence the IC sheaves <br> 
(intersection homology) of affine Schubert cells are associated with irreducible representations <br> 
of the Langlands dual group of G. The Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles are subvarietiesin the affine <br> 
Schubert cells, which give bases in the intersection homologies of those cells, thus playing a  <br>
fundamental role in the correspondence. Similar to the Weyl (weight) polytopes, the polytopes arising  <br>
as the images of Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles under the moment map w.r.t. the action of maximal compact torus T <br>
allow to (combinatorially) read off some information on representations of G (dimension of weight spaces, <br> 
 multiplicities of irreducibles in tensor products, etc.) I will assume only basic knowledge on affine <br> 
 Grassmannians (these <a href="NotesIntroAffGrassmannian.pdf"> notes</a> are more than sufficient). Examples will be given. <br>

<li> Nov. 5, Carl Wang-Erickson: An appearance of the affine Grassmannian in p-adic Hodge theory. <br> 
<b>Abstract.</b><br>
We give an overview of a few fundamental ideas in p-adic Hodge theory and conclude with an example of how an <br>
 affine Grassmannian contains moduli spaces of certain p-adic Hodge theoretic objects. <br>

<li> Nov. 12, Kiumars Kaveh: Bruhat-Tits building of SL(2). <br> 
<b>Abstract.</b><br>
Following Bill Casselman's notes, I will discuss how points in the affine Grassmannian for SL(2) and over a p-adic field <br>
(up to equivalence) can be thought of as nodes on an infinite tree. This is a special case of the Bruhat-Tits building of <br>
a reductive group over a local field. <br>
 We will use theory of modules over a DVR. The material are rather elementary and accessible to graduate students. <br>

<li> Dec. 09, Joel Kamnitzer: Mirkovic-Vilonen polytopes from geometry and algebra <br> 
<b>Abstract.</b><br>
A famous foundational problem concerns finding combinatorial expressions for tensor products <br>
of irreducible representations.  One way to solve this problem is to use the combinatorics of <br>
Mirkovic-Vilonen polytopes.  These polytopes were originally defined as moment map images  <br>
of MV cycles, but they also arise from the study of submodules of preprojective algebra modules.<br>
With Pierre Baumann and Allen Knutson, we defined measures supported on these polytopes.<br>
These measures allow us to perform computations which  distinguish among different bases<br>
for representations.<br>
