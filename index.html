<p>I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://mathdept.ucr.edu/" >Department of Mathematics </a> at the University of California, Riverside. </p>
<p>
My research interests revolve around representation theory and its interactions with algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and applications. 
In pure mathematics, I work in geometric representation theory, particularly on quantizations of conical symplectic resolutions, with an emphasis on Nakajima quiver varieties. 
I am also interested in various manifestations of the (derived) McKay correspondence and, more generally, in constructing meaningful maps between Hall algebras associated with (sub)categories of derived-equivalent varieties. 
In quantum computing, my work focuses on the performance analysis and structural properties of algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems. 
Of particular interest are the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and, more broadly, Variational Quantum Algorithms.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2020 at 
<a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics/">Northeastern University</a>, 
under the supervision of 
<a href="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/">Ivan Losev</a> 
and 
<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/gtodorov/#_ga=2.259945994.1274689294.1609725587-1396690592.1548539923">Gordana Todorov</a>. 
My Ph.D. thesis was devoted to the study of categories O on Nakajima quiver varieties associated with bouquet graphs. 
Please find it <a href="Thesis.pdf">here</a>.
